## D r e a m   V a c a t i o n

There are so many possibilities for a dream vacation, but as mentioned in interests.md, I'm interested in linguistics and a bunch of different languages. I currently know English, French, and Spanish, and am learning Russian and Japanese and maybe Mandarin soon! But A dream vacation for me would entail journeying with a few of my friends to a country whose language I am trying to learn. We'd likely rent a small little place for just us, and hang out most of the time, and explore whatever city or town we find ourselves in. We'd make friends with locals, enjoy our time, slowly become fluent with the language and see the beautiful sights that almost every other country can offer, if you look hard enough for them. But in essence, I don't have a set dream vacation. Vacations are all going to be grand for me, as long as I'm with friends.
